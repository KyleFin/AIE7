##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested:
      - e2e flow from UI to backend (API keys etc)
      - Model's ability to give a reasonable explanation in an area I'm familiar with.
      - Formatting within the app (text in `**` should be rendered as bold)
    - My app successfully returned a reasonable response. The markdown formatting (bold) can be improved.

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶ (I pasted the abstract of the paper about [LLM use degrading our brain performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872))
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Model's ability to understand a block of text, recognize key points, and provide a simpler summary that maintains the original meaning.
    - My app provided a reasonable (and useful) summary that was easier for me to understand than the original.

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Model's ability to expand on a small instruction to create something larger (with a specific length and topic).
    - My app provided a story that fits the description with 114 words.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Ability to understand mathematical intent, discern between which details are important, and work through multiple steps to calculate a precise expected answer.
    - My app succesfully understood and solved the problem, explaining its work clearly.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶ (I pasted the lyrics of Prince of Bel-Air theme :)
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Ability to understand the meaning of a passage and restate it in a different style.
    - Pretty impressive! lol

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

ANSWER: I used vibe coding to add better markdown handling for bold and bulleted lists. The vibes of the model responses seem good to me, so I left the model and prompt as they were.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

- We are only checking a tiny subset of the possible inputs our app could encounter.
- We're not testing its knowledge about domains in which we're not experts.
- We didn't test the consistency of the model.
- We didn't check if it can be made to generate offensive or inappropriate content (accidentally or maliciously)
