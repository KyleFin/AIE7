##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested:
      - e2e flow from UI to backend (API keys etc)
      - Model's ability to give a reasonable explanation in an area I'm familiar with.
      - Formatting within the app (text in `**` should be rendered as bold)
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested:
      - 
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested:

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### Submitting Your Homework
#### Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1 Only
Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE7` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
2. Create a markdown document (for example ‚ÄúACTIVITIES.md‚Äù).
3. Copy the questions into the document.
4. For each question:
    + Answer the ‚ÄúAspect Tested‚Äù question
    + Write up your evaluation of your system‚Äôs performance 
5. Answer ‚ÄúDiscussion Question #1‚Äù at the end of this document.
6. Add, commit and push your new document to your origin repository.
>(NOTE: You should not, merge the new document into origin‚Äôs main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each session.)

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub link to the new document on the tracking branch you created.

#### Activities, Discussion Questions _AND_ The Advanced Build:
For Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1, follow the same steps as above _**using your Challenge project's repo.**_

When submitting your homework provide the following on the form:
+ The GitHub URL to the markdown document you created in your Challenge project's repo.
+ The public Vercel URL to your updated Challenge project.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
