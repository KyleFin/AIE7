        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

His research interests have spanned everything from dialogue, including winning the first Amazon Alexa Prize in 2017, to fundamental research on text generation, such as proposing Nucleus Sampling, a decoding algorithm used broadly in deployed systems such as the OpenAI API. With the new wave of powerful generative models being continually released, Ari has argued for using [...] the lens of Complex Systems to understand generative models of human media, suggesting that a lack of precise behavioral vocabulary to describe what language models are doing is the bottleneck to explaining how language models are capable of such impressive performance on a range of tasks.

In natural language processing, importance is represented by \\\\\"soft\\\\\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called tokenembeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size. [...] Inspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\\\n\\\\nHistory\\\\n------- [...] Attention(A Q,B K,B V)=A Attention(Q,K,V){\\\\\\\\displaystyle {\\\\\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\\\\\mathbf {A} \\\\\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {B} \\\\\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {B} \\\\\\\\mathbf {V} )=\\\\\\\\mathbf {A} \\\\\\\\,{\\\\\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {V} )}Image 31: {\\\\\\\\displaystyle {\\\\\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\\\\\mathbf {A} \\\\\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {B} \\\\\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {B} \\\\\\\\mathbf {V} )=\\\\\\\\mathbf {A} \\\\\\\\,{\\\\\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\\\\\mathbf {V} )}\", \"score\": 0.94956195}, {\"title\": \"What is self-attention? | IBM\", \"url\": \"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-attention\", \"content\": \"Self-attention in machine learning models is similar to the human behavioral concept in that they both involve focusing on relevant elements within a larger context to accurately process information. In psychology, it is about focusing on your own thoughts or behaviors, while in deep learning, it is about focusing on the relevant parts of an input sequence. [...] Self-attention played a key role in the advancement of LLMs by enabling parallelization within training examples. This method is useful because the longer the sequence length, the more memory constraints limit batching across training examples. Using self-attention, LLM training data can be split into batches and processed concurrently on multiple GPUs.1 Self-attention reduces the computational power needed to train machine learning models with efficient batching processed in parallel.
