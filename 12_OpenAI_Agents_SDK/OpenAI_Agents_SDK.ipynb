      "## Introduction: What is the Great Plan of Happiness?\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine if your day was planned by your very wise and kind family, who made sure that you would always have sunshine after the rain and plenty of yummy snacks after playtime. In Latter-day Saint (LDS) theology, the \"Great Plan of Happiness\" (or Plan of Salvation) is a carefully thought-out design by Heavenly Father to help all His children (just like us little Aussies) understand our purpose and find our way back to Him. Just like our stories of nature in the outback, this plan begins long before we step out into the world, guiding us through every stage of life with kindness and hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Stages of the Journey: Pre-Mortal, Mortal, and Post-Mortal Lives\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Pre-Mortal Existence\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we were born, imagine a magical place where all the animals in the bush gathered for a big council—like a meeting of wise wombats, clever cockatoos, and bouncing kangaroos! In LDS theology, this is called the pre-mortal existence. Here, every spirit, including ours, lived with Heavenly Father. We were like little seeds under the care of the gardener, waiting for the perfect time to sprout.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mortal Life: Our Time on Earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortal life is like the journey of a little kangaroo that hops around to learn how to jump, explore the land, and find food. On Earth, we are given a body and the freedom to choose our path. Just as a kangaroo decides which direction to hop, we too make choices that shape our happiness and growth. This period is full of learning lessons—sometimes as fun as chasing butterflies and sometimes more challenging, like crossing a tricky creek.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Post-Mortal Life: A New Beginning\n",
      "\n",
      "After our earthly journey, our spirit moves on to a new adventure. Think of it as entering a beautiful, endless garden where all the animals and friends from different parts of Australia gather in everlasting happiness. In this eternal life, we have the opportunity to be with Heavenly Father, experience continuous joy, and even see the miracles of each day as vividly as the sparkling stars in the night sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Agency: The Freedom to Choose, Just Like a Curious Koala\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a friendly koala sitting up in a gum tree, deciding whether to munch on tasty eucalyptus leaves or to take a nap in the cool shade. This simple but important choice is like the concept of agency in the Great Plan of Happiness. Agency is the gift of freedom given by Heavenly Father to make choices. It is our personal power to choose between doing what is right or what might lead us away from our joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In LDS teachings, agency is celebrated as one of the most precious gifts. Just as our little koala friend can decide his next move according to his hunger or mood, every person gets to decide his or her path through obedience, learning, or even making mistakes that help refine and shape us, like the way a river smooths its stones over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Role of Jesus Christ: The Superhero of the Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s think of Jesus Christ as a brave and wise dingo in our outback adventure. This dingo isn’t just any ordinary animal; he is the hero who saves the day and protects all the others. In LDS theology, Jesus Christ is central to the Great Plan of Happiness. He offered his life to bridge the gap between us and Heavenly Father—a bit like putting on a superhero cape to rescue someone in great need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus’ Atonement is like a magical bandage that heals every boo-boo. When we make mistakes, just as a fallen branch in the bush might be fixed to sustain the tree, His Atonement covers our errors and allows us to recover and stand tall again. His sacrifice gives us the hope that no matter how many times we might tumble—just like a playful wallaby—we can always rise, learn, and keep hopping towards a life full of happiness and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Fall: A Necessary Hopping Lesson\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stories say that the Fall of Adam and Eve was a misfortune, but in LDS theology, the Fall is seen as a necessary step—like a slip on a wet rock that teaches a young kangaroo how to properly leap. The Fall allowed us to experience the real world with all its ups and downs. Without knowing a bit of sadness or messiness, we wouldn’t appreciate the moments of pure happiness, much like a lovely sunlit day after a cool rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eve’s gratitude for the Fall is like a kookaburra that laughs, despite a small tumble from its branch, because that fall taught it to seek stronger branches and new adventures. This part of the divine plan is essential because it gives us the opportunity to learn, grow, and ultimately, to return to a state of ultimate joy with Heavenly Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Living the Plan: Daily Acts that Bring Joy\n",
      "\n",
      "Living the Great Plan of Happiness means not only understanding it but also embracing it every day. Think of every day as a mini-adventure in a vast playground. Here are some ways to live happily according to the plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Obedience to God’s Commandments\n",
      "\n",
      "Living by God’s rules is like following the trail signs on a walk through the bush. They keep us safe and help us enjoy the journey without getting lost. Just as a curious bilby follows the scent of food back to its burrow, we too follow divine commandments to keep our hearts in tune with Heavenly Father’s love.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Daily Spiritual Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking time for prayer, reading scriptures, and doing good works are like stopping to drink cool water under a shady gum tree on a hot day. These moments refresh our spirit and keep us happy—just as a parched kangaroo finds comfort in a watering hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Blessing of Temple Worship and Covenants\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a secret, magical camp in the heart of the outback, reserved only for those who follow special rules. Temple worship is just like that—a special place where we make promises (covenants) with Heavenly Father, just like a mob of emus sticking together in safety. These promises help bind families together, much like the way a group of friendly wombats share a burrow during a cool night in winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cultivating Gratitude and Service\n",
      "\n",
      "Gratitude is the cheerful song of a kookaburra at dawn. When we appreciate the little gifts—the smile of a friend, the beauty of a sunset—we invite more happiness into our lives. And when we serve others, it’s like a kangaroo offering a helping paw to a smaller joey. These acts of service and gratitude can bring light even in cloudy times.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Choosing Happiness and Practicing Forgiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "Each morning, as the sun rises over the outback, we have a new chance to choose happiness. Just like a playful wombat deciding to dig a new burrow despite yesterday’s failed attempt, forgiving ourselves and others can open up paths to delightful joy. It’s a choice we make every day, allowing us to learn from our experiences and build a future as bright as the Australian sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion: A Path of Eternal Joy\n",
      "\n",
      "As we near the end of our adventure through the Great Plan of Happiness, think of this journey as an endless cycle of learning, growing, and discovering new fun paths, much like the ever-changing Australian bush full of surprises. Our life on this earth is just one leg of a magnificent journey that started in a brilliant pre-mortal world and will continue in an eternal paradise where we are always reunited with our heavenly family.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the plan is simple yet deeply profound: we are created to experience joy, learn through challenges, and return to a state of eternal happiness with Heavenly Father. Just as the animals of Australia rely on their instincts, community, and the wisdom passed down through generations, we too are guided by divine principles that promise us a life rich in purpose and heavenly delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "By understanding and embracing this plan, each one of us can be like a courageous little kangaroo, hopping with the assurance that every step—whether through sunlit clearings or over rocky trails—leads us closer to the ultimate picnic of eternal joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let this report remind you that no matter where you are on your journey, every choice, every leap of faith, and every act of love is a step toward an everlasting family reunion with our Heavenly Father. May your path be filled with the laughter of kookaburras, the gentle guidance of wise old wombats, and the boundless love of a beautiful eternal outback.\n",

These primitives are essential for orchestrating autonomous AI systems that perform key functions such as web search, file operations, and even actions on a computer. This report delves into the SDK's features, its operational architecture, integration capabilities, and how it compares to other frameworks in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI development tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts and Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the SDK are **agents**—intelligent entities that encapsulate a specific set of instructions and tools. Each agent is built on top of a large language model and can be customized with its own personality, domain expertise, and operational directives. For example, a \"Math Tutor\" agent could be designed to solve math problems by explaining each step clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key elements of an agent include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instructions:** Specific guidelines that shape the agent's responses and behavior in the context of its designated role.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Predefined or dynamically integrated tools that the agent can leverage to access external resources (e.g., web search or file search functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique feature introduced by the SDK is the concept of **handoffs**. Handoffs allow agents to delegate tasks to one another based on expertise and contextual needs. This orchestration paves the way for sophisticated workflows where multiple agents work in tandem, each contributing its specialized capabilities to complete a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety and reliability remain a cornerstone in AI development, and the SDK introduces **guardrails** as a means of controlling input and output validation. Guardrails help ensure that agents operate within defined safety parameters, preventing unintended actions and mitigating risks associated with autonomous decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Debugging and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process is further enhanced by built-in **tracing and visualization tools**. These tools offer real-time insights into agent interactions, tool invocations, and decision-making pathways, thereby making debugging and optimization more accessible and systematic. The tracing functionality is a vital feature for developers looking to fine-tune agent performance in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture and Developer Experience\n",
    "\n",
